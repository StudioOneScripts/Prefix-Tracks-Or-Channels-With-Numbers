# Prefix-Tracks-Or-Channels-With-Numbers

This prefixes tracks and channels with 3 digit numbers.  001, 002, etc, so that the files names of stem exports will line up in a predictable order on the file system.    

The "Target" argument value should be "Channels" or "Tracks" but it's not case sensitive.  
If no parameter is entered it defaults to channels.
