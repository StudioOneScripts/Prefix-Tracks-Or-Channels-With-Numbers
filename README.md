# Prefix-Tracks-Or-Channels-With-Numbers

This prefixes tracks and channels with 43 digit numbers.  001, 002, etc, so that the files names of stem exports will line up in a predictable order on the file system.  
Param should be "Channels" or "Tracks".  
If no parameter is entered it defaults to channels.  
Channels is the more reliable method as it includes Bus and FX channels
